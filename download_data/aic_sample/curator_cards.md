### Two Sisters (On the Terrace)
ID: 14655
**Artist / Date**: Pierre-Auguste Renoir · 1881
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: sisters, families, girls, girl, lake, water, trees, buildings, basket, hat, vines, peonies, foliage, red (color), blue, blue (color), weather/seasons, portraits, children, women, flowers, Century of Progress, world's fairs, Chicago World's Fairs
**Short description**: Despite the title, the young women in this painting were not actually sisters. The older girl in the center gazes absently beyond her younger companion, whose red cheeks suggest that she just dashed into the picture. These casual expressions make this “sisterly” moment feel genuine. Renoir juxtaposed the girls’ figures against a dreamy landscape, the basket of yarn evoking an artist’s palette.
**Alt text** (visual description): Impressionist painting of two girls on balcony, bright flower hat, knitting basket.

**Medium**: Oil on artist's board, mounted on cradled panel
**Subjects**: portraits, red (color), blue (color), green (color), orange (color), artist, self-portraits, emotions, men, suits, beards
**Short description**: Van Gogh’s face is as well known as his art—in fact, it is inseparable from it. The artist painted more than 35 self-portraits over his lifetime. This one was created in Paris under the influence of Seurat and pointillism. The intense dabs of paint and color, anchored by his eyes, create a turbulent energy, giving the viewer a deep sense of the artist’s presence.
**Alt text** (visual description): Painting of a red-haired, bearded man with light skin, painted in short brushstrokes and multicolored dots. The background is likewise a mass of small, closely spaced colored dots, these in green, blue, and red-orange.

**Artist / Date**: Mary Cassatt · 1893
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: people, domestic scenes, emotions, portraits, water, women, children, everyday life (genre), fashion
**Short description**: Known for her sensitive yet unsentimental scenes of women and children, Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to exhibit with the original French Impressionist group. In <em>The Child’s Bath</em>, one of her masterworks, she used cropped forms, bold patterns and outlines, and a flattened perspective, all of which she derived from her study of Japanese woodblock prints.
**Alt text** (visual description): Painting of mother in blue, purple, and green-stripped dress washing child's feet.

**Short description**: One of the most influential American painters of the 19th century, Winslow Homer is known for his dynamic depictions of both upper-class leisure pursuits and nature's power and beauty. The paintings he created after 1882 focus almost exclusively on humankind’s contest with nature. Here, Homer depicted the heroic efforts of fishermen hauling in an abundant catch of herring while steadying their boat amid turbulent swells.
**Alt text** (visual description): Painting of two fishermen in small wooden boat on rocky seas.

### The Fountain, Villa Torlonia, Frascati, Italy
ID: 69780
**Artist / Date**: John Singer Sargent · 1907
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: people, men, women, water, leisure, Century of Progress, world's fairs, Chicago World's Fairs, Chicago, fashion, portraits
**Short description**: The year 1907 was a turning point for Sargent; the sought-after portraitist stepped away from his successful portraiture career to pursue plein-air landscape painting. This work, depicting his traveling companions and fellow artists Wilfrid and Jane Emmet de Glehn, captures that moment of transition. Combining landscape and portraiture, the composition speaks to friendship and painterly pursuits while also celebrating color, light, and movement.
**Alt text** (visual description): Portrait of a woman in white with a bonnet perched on an architectural feature painting something to her right, a spouting water fountain, greenery, and a an ornate, low white fence behind her. Beside her, a man leans back, eying the canvas.

They are depicted clutching oranges tossed to them from the crowd as gifts. Although they are painted standing in the center of a circus ring, Renoir actually painted them in his studio, where he could take full advantage of natural sunlight.
**Alt text** (visual description): Two girls in acrobatic uniforms stand in an arena, one holds oranges.

**Short description**: “There has been none of my favorite snow," George Bellows wrote to a friend in January 1914. "I must always paint the snow at least once a year.” Soon after, a blizzard hit New York City, inspiring this painting. The bright colors and broad brushstrokes convey the pleasure and movement of the skaters and onlookers who are out enjoying a New York City winter.
**Alt text** (visual description): Painting of a crowd of well-dressed light-skinned people in an open, snowy field surrounded by large rolling hills. At center a woman in a bright-yellow coat and skirt holds the hand of a child in red, who pulls to turn her toward the others.

**Style**: Renaissance
**Medium**: Oil on panel
**Subjects**: portraits: male subject, chains, portraits, Century of Progress, world's fairs, Chicago World's Fairs, men, black (color), hats, jewelry, fashion
**Short description**: In his character studies, Rembrandt explored the effect of a single figure, made dramatic through the use of rich, subtle lighting and costumes, which the artist collected to transform his models. Here, the gold chain and steel gorget suggest an honored military career, while the plumed beret evokes an earlier time. The unidentified sitter, once thought to be the artist’s father, was a favorite model.
**Alt text** (visual description): Portrait of man wearing voluminous black cloak, feathered hat, and gold medallion.
**Image (IIIF)**: https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/3eaab3a3-2b47-9fdd-121c-050f6b8d9ccb/full/843,/0/default.jpg

**Short description**: William Glackens here portrayed members of his circle at a New York restaurant. The proprietor’s wife shares a drink with a wealthy playboy and restaurateur, while the artist’s wife and an art critic are reflected in the mirror. By combining portraiture and everyday scenes, Glackens helped usher in a mode of painting suited to the uncertainties and new social activities of modern urban life.
**Alt text** (visual description): Opulently dressed light-skinned man and woman drink at a small table. A mirror behind them reflects a crowd. Her blue dress and dark hat dominate.
**Image (IIIF)**: https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/b146368d-a855-63ac-6115-04b835c60bb0/full/843,/0/default.jpg


### The Captive Slave (Ira Aldridge)
ID: 193664
**Artist / Date**: John Philip Simpson · 1827
**Style**: nineteenth century
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: men, slavery, red (color), portraits: male subject, portraits: African subject, portraits, portrait, man, chains, actors (performing artists)
**Short description**: This painting by John Philip Simpson is both a powerful abolitionist statement and a striking portrait of the celebrated Shakespearean actor Ira Aldridge. A freeborn American, Aldridge became the first Black man to play Othello on the London stage in 1833. Simpson’s painting highlights Aldridge’s gifts of expression as a tragic actor.
**Alt text** (visual description): Painting of a dark-skinned man seated and wearing a red open-necked tunic. He looks up to the right. His wrists are shackled and a large chain rests at his right, running down the bench he sits upon.

**Subjects**: interiors, costume, portrait, portraits: European subject, portraits: female subject, Century of Progress, world's fairs, Chicago World's Fairs, hairstyles, fashion, dresses, books, women
**Short description**: Corot rarely exhibited his late figure paintings like this compelling example, focusing instead on his idyllic landscapes. While here he chose a traditional subject—the muse-like image of a woman reading a book—Corot showed his model pausing and looking up. He also used unconventionally bold brushwork while still delighting in detail—the ribbon in the model’s hair, the delicate earrings, and the deep folds in the skirt.
**Alt text** (visual description): A  pensive faced woman sits, slightly hunched, holding a book.
**Image (IIIF)**: https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/1c2d32a7-790c-501a-e124-00f28cf5052d/full/843,/0/default.jpg

ID: 97910
**Artist / Date**: Frederic Remington · 1890
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: fashion, animals, people, portraits
**Short description**: Frederic Remington, famous for his dynamic compositions of frontier life, presented mythic, romanticized views of the American West. Here, a cavalry scout, shot by an unseen Souix warrior, slumps over his horse while the troops behind him flee the ambush. Like most of his work, it was created for a white audience who understood the West as a place of both danger and opportunity.
**Alt text** (visual description): Three cavalry scouts—light-skinned men mounted on gleaming brown horses—among light-beige, arid mountains. The figure in the foreground has begun to to slump and seems poised to fall, his rifle on the ground, his horse agitated and alarmed. The others ride off in pursuit.

**Alt text** (visual description): Portrait of white man dressed in all black with medallion and sword.
**Image (IIIF)**: https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/8d119fd0-2f57-f20e-a3f5-a573904001e9/full/843,/0/default.jpg

**Subjects**: everyday life (genre), table, reading, painting, magazine, floral, fashion, black (color), tankard, beer, women, portraits, leisure, urban life, Century of Progress, world's fairs, Chicago World's Fairs
**Short description**: Édouard Manet was a pivotal figure in the development of Impressionism and modern art. Here, an elegantly dressed Parisian woman reads a magazine, a beer close at hand—a scene that would have struck contemporary viewers as fashionable and modern. While the woman appears to be outdoors, one of Manet’s paintings serves as a backdrop and other props suggest the scene was staged in Manet’s studio.
**Alt text** (visual description): A young woman in a dark hat and coat with light ruffled collar sits reading a large periodical held up in her gloved hands. Flowers and foliage are suggested behind her.

**Subjects**: portraits: child subject, deities, fruit, flowers, symbols, decoration, white (color), blue (color), fans, stripes, portraits: female subject, portrait, women, portraits, mysteries/fantasies, interiors, fashion, dresses, text, Tahiti, Tahitian people
**Short description**: In this portrait, Gauguin depicts the 13-year-old Tahitian girl Tehamana in a missionary dress holding a Samoan fan. A ripe mango alludes to fertility. In the background, Gauguin combined various non-European emblems—glyphs derived from an Easter Island tablet and a female deity inspired by Polynesian and Hindu sources—to build a generic sense of foreignness, transforming Tehamana into the embodiment of his own imagination.
**Alt text** (visual description): A young girl with medium skin wears a striking dress of black and white stripes with a short lace collar. Behind her is backdrop featuring symbols and native figures. Mangos sit beside her.
**Image (IIIF)**: https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/48268fc7-2eb4-ded6-1293-e91f27b66478/full/843,/0/default.jpg


### Madame de Pastoret and Her Son

**Style**: 18th Century
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: portraits, woman with children, portrait, portraits: European subject, portraits: French subject, portraits: female subject, interiors, dresses, white (color), domestic scenes, sewing, mothers, children, women
**Short description**: The French Revolution probably accounts for this portrait's unfinished state. While David completed the stippled underpainting, he did not create the smooth surface characteristic of his finished paintings. He did not even place a needle and thread in the subject's hand. Objecting to David’s revolutionary ideals, Madame de Pastoret refused the painting but had her adult son purchase the portrait after the artist's death.
**Alt text** (visual description): Large painting of young woman in white dress sitting next to crib.

**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: families, interiors, interior, portraits, domestic scenes, emotions, men, children, Century of Progress, world's fairs, Chicago World's Fairs
**Short description**: Perhaps the most subtle portrait painter in the Impressionist group, Edgar Degas painted this double portrait in the mid-1970s. It shows his orphaned first cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed—two people who are tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Having recently lost his own father, Degas addressed his subjects with awareness and sensitivity.
**Alt text** (visual description): Impressionist painting of seated man, girl with brown, black hues.

**Short description**: Amedeo Modigliani created his finest paintings between 1914 and his premature death in 1920. Focusing on a limited range of subjects, mainly portraits and nudes, he developed a highly distinctive style of sensitively elongated forms. Sculptor Jacques Lipchitz commissioned Modigliani to paint this portrait on the occasion of his marriage to the poet Berthe Kitrosser as a way of helping his troubled friend financially.
**Alt text** (visual description): Large painting, standing man blue turtleneck, sitting woman with white collar.

### Bar-room Scene
ID: 30709
**Artist / Date**: William Sidney Mount · 1835
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: dining, drinking, people, portraits
**Short description**: William Sidney Mount was one of the first American artists to specialize in scenes of everyday life. Here, Mount portrayed a boisterous group of patrons in a country tavern. Standing in the back corner is an African American figure who, as a free black man in 1830s New York, may have been able to frequent the tavern but did not participate fully in this community.
**Alt text** (visual description): In a beige room, a group of light-skinned men of various ages and a young boy clap as a figure in tattered clothing at center, his back to the viewer, dances and holds a tin cup in the air. At dark figure in shadows looks on from the far-right corner.
**Image (IIIF)**: https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/82a87cf0-6082-a7f7-c2cf-0fc9283ed966/full/843,/0/default.jpg

Dressed in robes, Lady Sarah Bunbury pours a libation of oil as an offering to the Three Graces, positioned behind her. Her fiancé, Charles Bunbury, commissioned this marriage portrait, making her association with the Graces—symbols of fertility and attendants to the Roman goddess of love, Venus—all the more appropriate.
**Alt text** (visual description): Large painting, woman in pink dress in front of classical sculpture, shrine.

**Short description**: Perhaps the most renowned American painter of religious works at the turn of the 20th century, Tanner moved to France in 1891 to escape the racism that limited his career.

**Alt text** (visual description): A work made of oil on canvas.

**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: fashion, dresses, portraits, women, people
**Short description**: John Singleton Copley garnered considerable success as a portrait painter before the Revolutionary War.

**Alt text** (visual description): Painted portrait of woman in green dress and cloud backdrop.
**Image (IIIF)**: https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/92777387-4f55-e3fa-10ba-a549810aca95/full/843,/0/default.jpg

**Short description**: Gustave Courbet played a crucial role in the development of modern French Realism. Critics and the public, however, did not easily accept his large, naturalistic, and unsentimental depictions of commonplace, often rural subjects. They called him the “apostle of ugliness.” This painting's subject, Mère Grégoire, was inspired by the heroine of a popular song, the proprietor of a brothel, written in the 1820s.
**Alt text** (visual description): Dark portrait of older woman in black dress with lace collar, flowers.

**Short description**: This portrait depicts Isabella Wolff, one of Sir Thomas Lawrence’s closest friends. Shown contemplating a printed image of the Delphic Sibyl from Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, Wolff assumes a pose that cleverly echoes another Sibyl from that same work. Sibyls, priestesses of Classical legend who made enigmatic judgments and prophecies, were often pictured according to Western fantasies of the Near East, hence Wolff’s elaborate turban.
**Alt text** (visual description): A light-skinned woman in a long, shiny white dress sits at a desk reading a book. The book is propped on a large red pillow. Her head is propped in her hand.

This work, painted in lively brushstrokes, represents another important aspect of his genius—his fantasy portraits, in which he referenced earlier artworks to enliven his own characterizations of patrons and artistic friends. In this instance, Fragonard references a painting of an actor by the Italian Baroque artist Domenico Fetti.

**Style**: Realism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: fashion, people, portraits
**Short description**: Thomas Eakins first met Mary Adeline Williams when she was a childhood playmate of his sister. Later, the unmarried Williams lived with Eakins and his wife, Susan. Although Eakins’s portrait presents Addie as straight-laced and severe, this is in marked contrast with the active woman Susan Eakins described in her diary, who rode bicycles, went to art exhibitions, and socialized between sittings for the painting.
**Alt text** (visual description): Dark portrait of an older light-skinned women with dark hair in a black dress and white collar, her hair pinned up. Her face is in partial shadow.

**Short description**: The Scottish-born painter John Smibert studied in London and Italy before settling in Boston in 1728. His skills as a trained formal portraitist were in great demand among Boston's wealthy and powerful colonists. Here, he depicted Richard Bill, a prosperous merchant and politically involved citizen. The large ship, visible through the window in the background, combined with Bill's elegant clothing, suggests his success and prestige.

ID: 4749
**Artist / Date**: John Singer Sargent · 1897
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: fashion, women, portraits, Chicago, people
**Short description**: John Singer Sargent was one of the most fashionable portraitists in late 19th-century Europe and America. Extravagant color and brushwork were central to Sargent’s success, as was his ability to present a refined image of his sitter. Here, Sargent accentuated Mrs. George Swinton's regal bearing and feminine dress, harmonizing the realism of her face with bursts of impressionistic brushstrokes describing her gown's shimmering fabric.

He completed this work in 1889, soon after returning from his stay in the hospital following Paul Gauguin’s fraught departure. Madame Roulin sits in Gauguin’s chair, an attempt by Van Gogh to fill the space left by the older artist. In May 1889, Van Gogh gave this canvas to Gauguin as a gesture of reconciliation and friendship.

**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: still life, animals, calfs, death, food, Market, oxen, portraits, circles
**Short description**: Caillebotte may have been inspired by the butcher’s shop below his family home in Paris when he painted this bloody scene of animal parts ready for human consumption. The painting confronts viewers with objects that are visually unpleasant and yet rendered with highly decorative pastel colors and soft brushstrokes.
**Alt text** (visual description): A white severed calf's head is suspended from a hook in its nose at right, painted with blue undertones and pink and yellow highlights. At left is a severed ox tongue and mouth rendered in soft white, pinks, and reds, all against a blue-gray background.

**Artist / Date**: Cecilia Beaux · 1898
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: fashion, dancers, families, portraits, children, people
**Short description**: Here, Cecilia Beaux explored the line between portraiture and figure painting by focusing less on the individuality of the sitters and more on their coordinated movements. Beaux was the rare woman artist competing for portrait commissions in the male-dominated art market of her time, and she fared exceedingly well. She was also an influential teacher and became the first woman to secure a faculty position at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.

### Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher)
ID: 95183
**Artist / Date**: Édouard Manet · 1865–67
**Style**: Realism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: portraits: male subject, philosophers, peasants, portraits, emotions, men, Century of Progress, world's fairs, Chicago World's Fairs
**Short description**: This painting and <em>Beggar with Oysters</em> were probably conceived as companion pieces. Manet exhibited them together in 1872, along with paintings of an absinthe drinker and a ragpicker, under the collective title <em>Philosophers</em>. Parisian beggars held a particular fascination for Realist artists and writers. By setting his large-scale figures against empty, dark backgrounds, Manet added to their portraitlike, indeed heroic, presence.

### Madame Paul Escudier (Louise Lefevre)
ID: 191183
**Artist / Date**: John Singer Sargent · 1882
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: portraits, Chicago, fashion, people
**Short description**: In this depiction of Louise Escudier, Sargent undercut traditional portrait conventions by prioritizing the dramatic effects of light and dark in a Parisian apartment. It's based on a series of atmospheric views of working-class women in darkened interiors that the artist produced on two trips to Venice  between 1880 and 1882. These compositions helped to establish Sargent’s reputation in Paris as a daring and original painter.

### Winged Figure
ID: 59798
**Artist / Date**: Abbott Handerson Thayer · 1889
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: mythology, people, portraits
**Short description**: Originally a painter of animals, Abbott Handerson Thayer created portraits and allegorical figures like <em>Winged Figure</em> after training in Paris. The artist wrote of his many seraphic subjects, “I have put on wings probably more to symbolize an exalted atmosphere . . . where one need not explain the action of his figures.” Thayer mixed this idealism with naturalism, individualizing the woman’s features and giving her a sense of mass and gravity.

### Polynesian Woman with Children

**Medium**: Oil on linen canvas
**Subjects**: portraits, portraits: child subject, pink (color), woman with children, woman, blue (color), portraits: multiple subjects, portrait, cats, women, children, Century of Progress, world's fairs, Chicago World's Fairs
**Short description**: The figures in this work have never been identified. Their pose and other details, such as the woman’s gold ring and the red mark on the girl’s hand, invite speculation as to their relationship to each other and to Gauguin. Technical analysis has revealed that he reworked the position of the woman’s hands to align diagonally with those of the young girl. Together, they form an upward axis reinforced by the cat, also a later addition.

### The Annunciation
ID: 7503
**Artist / Date**: George Hitchcock · 1887
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: people, Chicago, landscapes, portraits
**Short description**: In George Hitchcock’s unusual presentation of the Annunciation, the virgin is depicted as a Dutch peasant girl standing in a field of lilies. The lily is a symbol of the angel Gabriel, and Mary’s downcast eyes imply that she has received his divine message. Hitchcock spent much of his life in Holland, and his choice of a religious subject, unusual composition, and interest in light effects synthesizes elements of several European art movements.

In this intimate early portrait, David presented his aunt looking up momentarily from her reading. Her glance suggests an affectionate bond between the painter and sitter.

**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas

**Short description**: Bazille was in his mid-20s when he executed this startlingly direct self-portrait.

It was both a practice piece and, given his recent decision to abandon a medical career in favor of art, a professional manifesto.

### Boy with Pitcher (La Régalade)
ID: 29392
**Artist / Date**: Édouard Manet · 1862–72
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: portraits, pitcher, children, water
**Short description**: X-radiographs have revealed that this painting is a fragment of <em>Les Gitanes</em>, a large portrait of a gypsy family exhibited by Manet in 1863 and 1867. Apparently dissatisfied with his complex imitation of Spanish Baroque art, he cut the original painting into three sections and reconceived this portion as an individual work of art. Manet renamed it <em>La Régalade</em>, which means to pour liquid from a bottle down the throat without touching the lips.

**Medium**: Oil on paper mounted on panel
**Subjects**: people, women, portraits, men, work, fashion
**Short description**: By the mid-1860s, American artist James McNeill Whistler was increasingly fascinated with the aesthetics of Asian art. Here, Whistler stares out at the viewer with palette and paintbrush in hand, surrounded by works from his collection: three Japanese scrolls on the wall and Chinese porcelain on the shelves at the left. The artist applied thin layers of paint in muted tones to evoke the flattened appearance of Japanese woodblock prints.

**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas

**Short description**: Here, a fashionably dressed woman sits alone and alert in a Parisian café. Her presence is a sign of modern Paris’s changing social environment, in which café culture offered women new opportunities for leisure in public spaces. Although artist Fernand Lungren employed a dense, hard-edged style, his interest in modern life and the effects of light (here both gas and electric lighting) was nevertheless indebted to French Impressionism.

### Peach Blossoms
ID: 55494
**Artist / Date**: Winslow Homer · 1878
**Style**: Impressionism
**Medium**: Oil on canvas
**Subjects**: people, fashion, landscapes, portraits
**Short description**: Early in his career, Homer often depicted scenes of leisure, such as this young woman looking at peach blossoms. The setting itself reflects nostalgia for a fading rural past. Homer's use of a lighter palette was inspired by Impressionism, and the linearity of the tree is reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy. While critics often noted the innate American quality of Homer's work, this painting indicates the global artistic exchange of the time.

The view of the shop is dark except for the strokes of light green and silvery paint that describe the canes of glass.
